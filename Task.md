# Challenge: Developer Productivity

## Overview
You are working as part of a global engineering team that builds tools and solutions for the internal developer community. You have been tasked with finding out how productivity changes over time based on the different tools & solutions made available to the company.

## Objective
Your objective is to build a simple application gathering data and a simple report using that data that indicates the productivity of teams (individual engineers/contributors) against a single repository over time. The source code repository used is GitHub and you have read only access to the repos (you can use public repos on GitHub.com as your data source for this exercise).

Here are some things you might want to consider :

    1. How can the data be efficiently collected
    2. How do you ensure accuracy of data over time
    3. What you can do to make the output useable by an audience of non-technical consumers 4. What would make a viable MVP
    5. What other features might you add to your solution in the future


We would expect you to include a readme in the repo containing
- instructions to build and run the solution
- next steps if you do not get a full working solution
- next steps/opportunities for a follow on version
- how you approached the problem including any pivots/change in direction as you increased your understanding and why highlight any interesting technical and design aspects of the solution

## Approach & Guidance
- Feel free to use any of the languages covered in the job description from us.
- Your solution does not need to be complete but it should work and you should note where there are further pieces of functionality that need to be added to become complete.
- It would be advantageous to add a Github Actions Workflow that demonstrates the code compiling, building and running.
- The assessors are looking at how you approach the challenge rather than the end result. Please articulate all your thinking about how you would run the solutions, considerations, future iterations etc.
- The exercise should take no longer than a couple of hours but you will be given 7 days in which to complete it. You can use any resources at your disposal in order to complete the challenge just as you would in the workplace.
